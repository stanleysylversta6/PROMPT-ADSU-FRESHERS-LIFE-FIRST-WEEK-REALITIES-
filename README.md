## HOST DIALOGUE (READ FROM iPAD)
**(Natural, confident, funny delivery)**
“So… welcome to Adamawa State University.
First week as a fresher.
You came with one small bag, but your roommate came with her whole village.”
(small smile, glances up briefly)
“You thought lectures start by 8…
ADSU said 8 means ‘whenever the lecturer arrives’.”
(reads again)
“First night in the hostel, everybody promising themselves:
‘I will focus.’
Second week… group chat already planning weekend food.”
(soft laugh, back to iPad)
“But honestly…
This place teaches you independence, patience…
And how to survive without data.”
